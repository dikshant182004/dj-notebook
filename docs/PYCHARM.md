# Getting Started with PyCharm: A Comprehensive Guide
## INTRODUCTION :-
With Jupyter Notebook integration available in PyCharm , you can easily edit, execute, and debug notebook source code and examine execution outputs including stream data, images, and other media.

Notebook support in `PyCharm` includes:

- Coding assistance:
- Error and syntax highlighting.
- Code completion.
- Ability to create line comments Ctrl0/.
- Ability to run cells and preview execution results.
- Dedicated `Jupyter Notebook` Debugger.
- Shortcuts for basic operations with Jupyter notebooks.
- Ability to recognize .ipynb files and mark them with the ipynb file icon icon.

## Jumpstart Your Jupyter Notebook Experience in PyCharm

To start working with Jupyter notebooks in PyCharm:
- Set Up Your Environment:
- Create a new Python project.
- Specify a virtual environment.
- Install the Jupyter package.
- Open or Create a Notebook:
- Open an existing `.ipynb` file or create a new one.
- Edit and Add Cells:
- Add and edit source cells in the notebook as needed.
- Execute Code Cells:

Execute any of the code cells to start the `Jupyter server` and run your code.

## Get familiar with the user interface

Mind the following user interface features when working with Jupyter notebooks in PyCharm.

Jupyter Notebook Interface Overview:

- Jupyter Notebook Toolbar: This toolbar provides quick access to frequently used actions. While additional notebook-specific actions are available in the` Cell menu`, this toolbar offers convenient shortcuts for common tasks.
- Code Cell: A code cell within the notebook is where you write and execute executable code. These cells are where you input your Python code for `analysis, calculations, or data manipulation.`
- Cell Output: After executing a code cell, the results are displayed in the` cell output area`. This output can take various forms, including text, tables, or plots, depending on the code's purpose and the libraries used.
- Cell Toolbar: The cell toolbar, typically hidden by default, contains essential commands for managing code cells. To enable this toolbar, navigate to Project Settings `(Ctrl+Alt+S)`, go to Languages & Frameworks | Jupyter, and check the "Show cell toolbar" option. Once enabled, it provides shortcuts and options for working with code cells efficiently.

## Cell toolbarï»¿

Each code cell has its configurable toolbar so that you can easily access the most popular commands and actions. By default, `cell toolbars` are disabled. To enable them, open project Settings `(Ctrl+Alt+S)`, go to Languages & Frameworks | Jupyter, and select the Show cell toolbar checkbox.

## Tool windows
The `Server Log` tab within the Jupyter tool window becomes accessible once you launch a Jupyter server. Within this tab, you can monitor the `real-time status` of the Jupyter server and conveniently access the link to open your notebook in a web browser.
